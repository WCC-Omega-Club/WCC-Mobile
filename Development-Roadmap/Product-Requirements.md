###[x] ~~Concept/Requirements~~<br />
>Basic idea for the app. Description of _what the product should do_. Usually results in a Product Requirements Document.<br />
Go back to overall roadmap in main (README.md).

**App should have all the hallmarks and features of comparable college mobile apps.**<br /><br />
  Best Examples, see:<br />
  _University of Arizona Mobile_<br />

App should exist as a Main parent-app, containing many smaller sub-apps.
Potential Sub-App Features include:
- Map
- Events/Calendar
- Email
- Blackboard
- Directory
- News
- Transit
- Athletics
- Career Services
- Counseling
- Transfer Services
- Student Involvement

It's important to note that this app exists **for the students.**<br />
The underlying purpose is to help students, especially those who may be confused by the main WCC website, achieve their academic goals by getting access to the _information they need_ in an **intuitive**, **simple** way.<br /> <br/>
